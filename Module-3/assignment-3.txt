Collaboration is tough for me.

I think that I can do it but mostly from a leadership or guiding role. It is difficult for me, (though I would love to find it)
making connections that I have confidence in listening to and taking input. I have a track record of being
a little ahead of the herd, so to speak as far as understanding system operation and theory. So, I often
have to sift through the ideas and suggestions for errors, and find myself half listening to
those whom I wouldn't consider an SME. But even those that I do consider SME's I still
scrutinize.

So that is a personal problem that I don't show overtly, I wrestle with this internally.
But seek and would love to find a situation in which I can give over trust completely..
