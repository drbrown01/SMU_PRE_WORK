This is one item that I was unfamiliar with:

"Agile methodology"

Definition: Not a methodology! The Agile movement seeks alternatives
to traditional project management. Agile approaches help teams respond
to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences, 
known as sprints. Agile methodologies are an alternative
to waterfall, or traditional sequential development.
